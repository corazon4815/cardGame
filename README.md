### 🎈 Game Rule

	This game is a game played with a set of cards. 
    The cards have a pictures on one side and each picture appears on two cards. 
    The game starts with all the cards face down and players take turns to turn over 
    two cards. If the two cards have the same picture, then disappeared the cards, 
    otherwise they turn the cards face down again.
    If you leave the browser, your score will be maintained.
    I hope you enjoy it. 😊😊😊
